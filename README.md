COMP1202 Courseowork Year 2023-2024

Specification

This coursework allows you to demonstrate that you:

• Understand how to construct simple classes and implement methods.

• Are able to take simple pseudo-code descriptions and construct working Java code from them.

• Can write a working program to perform a complex task.

• Have an understanding of object-oriented programming.

• Can correctly use polymorphism, exceptions and I/O.

• Can write code that is understandable and confirms good coding practice.

For this coursework, you are expected to follow the specification of a university as set out below.
This may not correspond exactly to a university in reality but we have chosen particular aspects
for you to model that help you to demonstrate your Java programming skill.
There are several objects and people that contribute to the university. For our purposes,
these include:

• Halls – facilities providing accommodation for students.

• Labs – facilities for laboratory sessions, required for students to train their practical
skills.

• Theatres – facilities for lectures, required for students to learn theoretical knowledge.

• Staff: Staff instruct the students in laboratory sessions and lectures.

The main purpose of EcsSim is to build facilities and to hire staff using “EcsCoins” (the
simulation currency) to create a successful university. The university will gain its reputation
and EcsCoins by teaching the students.

The format of running file is java EcsSim <Staff_Configuration_File> <Initial_Funding> <Years_To_Simulate>

Staff text file should be in the format of : "Name (Skill)"
